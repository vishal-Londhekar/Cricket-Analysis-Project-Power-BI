# Cricket-Analysis-Project-Power-BI
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth Cricket Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI.
Data was collected through web scraping from **ESPN Cricinfo** - https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html, then transformed, modeled, and visualized to extract meaningful cricket insights.

The goal of this project is to:

* Demonstrate data collection using web scraping.
* Apply data modeling and transformation in Power BI.
* Use DAX functions for calculated measures and columns.
* Build an interactive dashboard for exploring cricket statistics.

📂 Project Files

* Cricket Project.pbix → Power BI Desktop file containing the full report.
* README.md → Documentation for GitHub (this file).

⚙️ Data Workflow

1. Data Extraction – Web scraping from ESPN Cricinfo using Python/Power Query.
2. Transformation – Cleaned, structured, and formatted the data for analysis.
3. Modeling – Built relationships between datasets and created a Calendar Table (best practice in Power BI).
4. DAX Functions – Created calculated columns and measures (e.g., batting averages, strike rates, win ratios).
5. Visualization – Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI.

📊 Dashboard Highlights

* Player performance comparison (runs, wickets, strike rates, averages).
* Match analysis (venues, opposition teams, formats).
* Trends over time using time intelligence in DAX.
* Filters and slicers for dynamic data exploration.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Power BI Desktop (Data modeling, DAX, Visualization)
* Python / Power Query (Web scraping & Data Transformation)
* ESPN Cricinfo Stats (Source website)

🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Cricket Project.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard using filters and visuals.

📌 Future Improvements

* Automating web scraping for scheduled data refresh.
* Expanding dataset with player-specific or match-specific stats.
* Deploying dashboard to Power BI Service for online access.
